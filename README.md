A list of ideas and potential future projects

Hello Everyone!
Kburdick here, I am a physics major entering the final year of my bachelor's degree. I want to try and land a job in software when I graduate so I think this will be a nice place to hold my projects and other interesting things that I have done/will do in the future.
